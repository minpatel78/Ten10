Wikepedia-TEN10 TEST====================

Tools Used:
Programming Language: JAVA
Maven -  Java Project Management Tool (We can run our tests with maven commands)
         And Helps to maintain the dependencies and inter dependencies for the project
         We can find all the dependenciess at https://mvnrepository.com
Cucumber-JVM - is a pure Java implementation of Cucumber that supports the [most popular programming languages](https://cukes.info/docs/reference/jvm#running) for the JVM.
                You can [run](https://cukes.info/docs/reference/jvm#running) it with the tool of your choice.
Selenium WebDriver - Web browser applications Automation Tool
                    http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/

Pre-requisites: The following softwares are needed to run this project
1. JDK Installations:
    Windows:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/index.html
    Mac: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html
2. Maven Installations: Download Maven from https://maven.apache.org/install.html and configure in the system
    please run `mvn --version` from command line to see mvn
3. Selenium WebDriver (we can add dependecies to POM.XML file)
4. Cucumber JVM (we can add dependecies to POM.XML file)
5. chromedriver file to run the tests on chrome browser (download from http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.24/)
    Its already downloaded here in this project, so no need of downloading it)
    NOTE: If you running the tests in `Windows` Please change the path for the profile as shown below
    ```  @Before
           public void startBrowser() {
               System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "src/main/resources/chromedriver.exe");
               driver= new ChromeDriver();
               driver.get(baseURL);
               driver.manage().window().maximize();
               driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
           }```

6. Run The Tests from command line:
   Unzip the project folder
   Open command line bash, go to the project folder where you got pom.xml file and run the below command
   if you want to run all the scenarios you can use `@smoke` tag as below
   `mvn clean test -Dcucumber.options= "-Dtags =@search"`
   if you want to run specific scenario you can use `@specificTagName` tag as below
   `mvn clean test -Dcucumber.options= "-Dtags =@specificTagName"`
    or you can run `RunTest.java` which triggers the tests

7. Using IDE:
   we can use IntellijIdea or eclipse
   Download Intellij Idea Community Edition (for FREE) from: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
   Make Sure you got below Plugins installed on Intellij Idea:
   Cucumber for java, Maven and JAVA is cofnigured to Intellij Idea

8. Run the project Using IDE
    Make sure JAVA is configured to Intellij Idea and other plugins (Cucumber, Maven)
    Unzip the Project and Open the project folder in IntelliJ Idea IDE
    You can change the tags accordingly in `RunTest.java` file and Run `RunTest.java` class

9. Folder Structure
